# Analysis of news about the Amazon in the light of the Sustainable Development Goals

## Abstract
The Amazon is the largest tropical forest in the world, with great importance for climate regulation and global biodiversity preservation. Given its relevance and in light of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is pertinent to investigate how they are being implemented in the Amazon region. Therefore, this work analyzes Amazon-related news to identify the most discussed topics and their relationships with the SDGs. Text mining and content analysis techniques were used to correlate news with the SDGs. These analyses were based on grounded theory, weak labeling, and topic modeling. The results show that private companies operate in reforestation and environmental protection programs; the government also plays an essential role in combating deforestation and poverty, influencing environmental policies, and strengthening environmental regulation and partnerships with other countries. Such factors are aligned directly with SDGs 13 and 15, which are aimed at forest conservation, natural resources sustainable management, international cooperation, and other strategies to mitigate environmental impacts in the region. We conclude that the SDGs contribute to preserving the Amazon ecosystem, covering not only terrestrial and aquatic life but also the health and well-being of the traditional people who inhabit the region.
