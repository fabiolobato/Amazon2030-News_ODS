# Analysis of news about the Amazon in the light of the Sustainable Development Goals

## Abstract
The Amazon is the largest tropical forest in the world, with great importance for climate regulation and the preservation of global biodiversity. Given its relevance and in light of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it is pertinent to check how they are being implemented in the region. Therefore, the objective of this work is to analyze news related to Amazon to identify the most discussed topics and their relationships with the SDGs. For this, text mining and content analysis techniques of news related to the Amazon were used, verifying their correlation with the SDGs. These analyses were based on grounded theory, weak labeling, and topic modeling. The results obtained show that while private companies operate in reforestation and environmental protection programs, the government also plays an important role in combating problems, influencing environmental policies, and strengthening environmental regulation and partnerships with other countries. Such factors align directly with SDGs 13 and 15, aimed at forest conservation, sustainable management of natural resources, international cooperation, and other strategies that aim to mitigate environmental impacts in the region. Therefore, it is concluded that the SDGs contribute to the preservation of the Amazon, covering not only terrestrial and aquatic life but also the health and well-being of the traditional people who inhabit the region.
